#summary This page shall show performance characteristics of the memcached-session-manager.

= Introduction =

This page shall show performance characteristics of the memcached-session-manager (msm). For this there's a simple web application, which can be run with different msm configurations including different session serialization strategies. Additionally this web application shall show, how performance depends on session size.


= Details =

The web application is written in java, making use of [http://wicket.apache.org wicket]. It provides several pages:
  * StatelessPage - a simple page without any state.
  * SessionPage - a page without real wicket state, but it creates an http session.
  * StatefullPage - a page with state, you can click and increment a counter.
  * ListLightPage - a page with state, showing a list of items for which their ids are stored in the session.

For performance testing I chose [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/ab.html ab].

Tests were done using the following parameters:
{{{
ab -n 10000 -c 200 http://localhost:8080/statefull
}}}
