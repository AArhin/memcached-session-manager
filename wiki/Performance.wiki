#summary This page shall show performance characteristics of the memcached-session-manager.

= Introduction =

This page shall show performance characteristics of the memcached-session-manager (msm). For this there's a simple web application, which can be run with different msm configurations including different session serialization strategies. Additionally this web application shall show, how performance depends on session size.


= Details =

The web application is written in java, making use of [http://wicket.apache.org wicket]. It provides several pages:
  * StatelessPage - a simple page without any state.
  * SessionPage - a page without real wicket state, but it creates an http session.
  * StatefullPage - a page with state, you can click and increment a counter.
  * ListLightPage - a page with state, showing a list of items for which their ids are stored in the session.

For performance testing I chose [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/ab.html ab].

Tests were running on my local laptop, both memcached and tomcat, and also ab were running on the same machine. One might run the tests with different setups to see how numbers change.

ab was executed using the following parameters:
{{{
ab -n 10000 -c 200 http://localhost:8080/statefull
}}}

(10000 requests, 200 concurrent)
